DON'T FORGET TO APPLY THE UBUNTU FIXES, IF COPY/PASTING!

Some don't make any measurable comptime improvements, but anyway they're not used.

On my current setup, compilation without (deb's or changes below) takes ~8'.

To test:

```sh
make mrproper
cp .config{.sav,}
# (apply diff)
make olddefconfig
/usr/bin/time -f "TIME: %e" make -j $(nproc)
plin
```
