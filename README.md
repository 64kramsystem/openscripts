OpenScripts
===========

`OS` is a collection of some of my scripts for personal use:

- `update_mainline_kernel.rb`: automatically installs the latest version of the current (or chosen) kernel, from the Ubuntu mainline builds
- `clean_kernel_packages.rb`: uninstall the redundant kernel packages, keeping only the current, and the latest (past or future)

I will slowly add all the remaining ones.
